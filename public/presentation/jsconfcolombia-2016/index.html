      <h2>How I learned English</h2>
      <p>I first started learning English at 7th grade. In Japan, at least when I took English class, "This is a pen" was a omnipresent sentence which every English text book used as 1st sentence to learn.</p>
      <p>It's useless as a English sentence, but it was simple to get started. I was really excited to learn new language, so at first, I even took extra curricular to learn English. </p>

    <section class="scrolly-section" data-slide-id="english2">
      <p>As you advance in lessons, things got a lot complicated. You start reading paragraphs instead of a sentence. Questions asked in exams become more about understanding context, and what's happening in the reading, than if you remembered a meaning of a word.</p>

      <p>One this that helped me while I was learning English was visualizing how sentences are structured. I'm a visual learner, I tend to perform well when I can draw what is happening.</p>
      <p>This is a note I made while I was learning Rust. It helped me a lot. In fact, I took this learning style from when I learned English.</p>

    <section class="scrolly-section" data-slide-id="english6">
      <p>There are certain rules in English. For example, a and the are always followed by a noun, a verb is always followed by subject, word ending with -ly is usually adverb which can not be added to a noun... etc. This is how I used these rules to de-construct English sentence to something I can understand.</p>

    <section class="scrolly-section" data-slide-id="english7">
      <p>Of cause, English is a very divers language, and there is always new grammar and word invented, so these rules are often broken. For example, "I'm lovin' it" is not grammatically correct. The verb "Love" does not have continuous version of that. If you are using "loving" then it has to be adjective.</p>
      <p>To be grammatically correct, you would say "I love it." JavaScript was a human it would probably throw an error</p>

      <h2>How I learned to make new language.</h2>
      <p>Lat summer I spent a week writing a small programming language, which would compile knitting instructions into a pattern image.</p>
      <p>In process of this, I had to make a compiler. This was completely new language I made up, so I needed to transform them so that browser can understand to make those patterns.</p>

      <h2>How does a compiler work?</h2>
      <p>Let's look at what just happened in our head as a compiler right now. A compiler goes through a series of steps to transform a code to another form.</p>
      <h3>Tokenization</h3>
      <p>First thing we did was to spread each key words.</p>

      <p>It's easy to spot what's a word in English because we use spaces to separate them. So it may seem like not even a step, but in language like Japanese it will be an effort to separate words.</p>

      <p>But wouldn't compiler require a recursion and traversal and visitor etc ?</p>
      <p>Yes, those are all wonderful way to build a compiler, but that doesn't mean you have to take that approach. Yes, if we were to expand this little language into more complex one, it would be a good idea to use those technique, but it is not a requirement.</p>

      <p>Knowing how to make a compiler is really powerful and fun. Do you use Babel ? Babel is a type of compiler. Have you ever wanted to type "función" in stead of "function" ? You can make compiler for that.</p>

      <h3>It's okay to have unfamiliar things.</h3>
      <p>Much like our lexical analyzer, you don't need to know everything from the begging. So if you don't really understand a piece of code or technology, it's okay to just say. "There is a thing, I know that much" and pass it on to next step. Don't stress about it, you'll get there eventually.</p>

      <h3>Don't be a jerk with bad error message.</h3>
      <p>Parser's role is to follow the rule and check if things are written according to those rules. So many times, error happens. When it does, try to send helpful and welcoming messages. It's easy to say "It doesn't work that way", like "ILLEGAL Token" error or "undefined is not a function" message. In stead, try to tell users what should happen as much as you can.</p>
      <p>When someone is stuck with a question, instead of saying "yeah that doesn't work", may be you can start saying "I would google __ and __ keywords." or "I recommend reading this page on documentation." You don't need to do a work for them, but you can certainly help them do the work better.</p>

      <h3>Context is everything</h3>
      <p>Finally, just like our transformer transformed one type of AST to another more fitting one for the final result. There is no one perfect way to do things. Everything is context specific.</p>
      <p>So don't just do things because it is popular or you have done it before, think about the context first. Things that work for one user may be a disaster for another user.</p>
      <p>Also, applicate the work those transformers do, you may know good transformers in your team, those work they put in to bridge the gap may not directly create a program, but it is a damn important work in our community.</p>
